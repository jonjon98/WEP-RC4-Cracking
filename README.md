# WEP_RC4_Cracking_App

## Background
Wired Equivalent Policy (WEP) come out as part of the original 802.11 standard in 1997. It has seen a huge decrease in usage however due to weaknesses of the cipher that is incorporated in it being widely known. WEP uses the Alleged Rivest Cipher 4 (ARC4) algorithm for confidentiality and Cyclic Redundancy Check-32 (CRC-32) for integrity. In this project, we would be focusing on cracking the ARC4 cipher in order to obtain the secret WEP key. This would allow us to demostrate the weakness of WEP and why most routers today default to other protocols such as WPA/WPA2.
